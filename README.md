  ## **Description**
  
  Utilizing React.js, and a starting template, create a webpage with the following requirements:

    1. Build a single webpage using at least 1 of the provided APIs beside user.js as a data source.
    2. Add to state
    3. Remove from state
    4. Use props (you’ll need to add your own component file to the project)
    5. Create a search field that filters what is shown to the client
    6. Styling is up to you. Doesn’t have to be beautiful, but if you have a good css idea you’re welcome to go for it!
    

  Bonus:

    1. Use 2 or more of the API files
    2. Add an additional API file.
    3. Feel free to add your own features and functionality (having a search bar is just the minimum requirement).
